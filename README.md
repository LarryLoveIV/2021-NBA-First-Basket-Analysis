# 2021-NBA-First-Basket-Analysis
An automated daily run of NBA data to find jump ball winners and 1st FGAs and 1st FGMs

## Purpose:
I put together this project halfway through the 2021 NBA season and used it to place Round Robin style bets with online sportsbooks.

## Goal:
The ultimate goal was to use the data to build a machine learning model that wouldbe able to predict which players would score the first basket.
Work and life kind of took over and I never got that far, but wanted to share my code in case anyone found it useful.
